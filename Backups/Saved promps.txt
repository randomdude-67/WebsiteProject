the payload conveyors dont actually work at all, make it so that if it is directly connected to the output of a miner constructor, it will output to the conveyor, which will transport it, also most of the debug cheats dont actually work, please fix. YOu knwo the arrow that points to the factory whenever it is off screen? Remove it and add it back to the core so you always know where the core is. Also Im having an issue in which the map never renders and only the UI works, nothing else
